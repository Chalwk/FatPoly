# FatPoly - Love2D Android & Windows Game

> Geometry meets gluttony
> Author: Jericho Crosby (Chalwk)

Concept:

You control a white square. Various geometric shapes float across the screen, representing healthy and unhealthy food particles.

* Eating green shapes (circles, triangles, polygons, 3D shapes) makes your character grow in size.
* Eating red shapes (squares, rectangles, ovals, other geometric shapes) causes you to lose health.
* If your health reaches zero, your character dies.
* As you eat more food and grow larger, avoiding unhealthy food becomes more challenging.

LEVEL SYSTEM:
* Progress through 10 increasingly difficult levels with higher speeds and food density
* Each level requires eating a specific number of food particles to advance
* Player size slightly decreases when advancing to new levels for increased challenge

SPECIAL EFFECTS SYSTEM:
Purple circles appear periodically with timed effects:

1. Rush Hour & Traffic Jam - All food particles speed up or slow down
2. All You Can Eat & Food Contaminated - Reverse food effects (healthy becomes bad, unhealthy becomes good)
3. Weight Gain & Weight Loss - Immediate size change (gain 10 units or lose 8 units)
